Spockk is an add-on for the https://spockframework.org/[Spock] testing framework that aims to provide Kotlin-native version of Spock's expressive specification syntax.
Spockk is not a standalone testing framework and must be used in combination with Spock.
Spockk used together with Spock's JUnit Platform test engine is compatible with most build tools and IDEs.
