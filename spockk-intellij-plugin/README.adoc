= spockk-intellij-plugin

Provides support for Spockk tests in IntelliJ.
The built-in plugin for Spock tests does a lot of the heavy lifting:

- It detects specifications and features.
- It provides Gradle run configurations for those tests.

This plugin adds a single extension that ensures that Kotlin-specific syntax for feature blocks is not marked as unused by IntelliJ.

== Noteworthy components

- link:src/main/kotlin/io/github/pshevche/spockk/intellij/SpockkUnusedBlockInspectionSuppressor.kt[SpockkUnusedBlockInspectionSuppressor]: prevents block labels from being marked as unused.
This only applies to labels without descriptions.
